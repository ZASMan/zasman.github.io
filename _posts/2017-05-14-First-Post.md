Thanks for checking out my site. As you might have seen on the home page of this site, one of my hobbies is language learning, and often times I only have a few minutes a day to practice, be it by a lesson on an app like Duolingo or some messages with a native speaker.

Having a blog gives me a more laid back approach, I can take my time to research words, repeat them, and hopefully improve! I'll try and keep it entertaining for the reader as well.
